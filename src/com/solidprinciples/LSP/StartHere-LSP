--------------------LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE---------------------------

- LSP States that object of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without altering
the correctness of the program.

- Check out the Vehicle Class, Car, Boat, and Motorcycle Classes.
- Then go check out Main within the package.
- The DMV class expects a Vehicle but we have the ability to pass in any of the subclasses of VEHICLE

- ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN TEXT :

If we have a Bird base class (superclass) and a Penguin subclass. The Bird class has a method called fly.
The Penguin clas inherits from Bird and can override the fly method to do nothing since penguins don't fly.

- LSP states that if a program expects a Bird Object it should work with a Penguin object as well because Penguin
is a specific type of Bird and can substitute the Bird object.
