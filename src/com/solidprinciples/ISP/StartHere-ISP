------------------INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE--------------------------
- States that a class SHOULD NOT be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

- 1. Go check out the ANIMAL Interface to get started, here you will see the FISH and BIRD Classes

--USING ISP--
- 2. Check out the different Interfaces Flyable, Swimmable, Eatable (all in the Flyable file)
- 3. Check out BirdISP, FishISP. You can see that the classes only implement the interfaces that they need
     so we do not have to force the fish to swim or throw an error (not a good fix).
