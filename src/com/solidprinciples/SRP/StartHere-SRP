--------------------------SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE-------------------------------

States that a class should only have one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.

ISSUE:
- If we have a car class which has both the responsibilities of driving and playing music <- this violates SRP

- Check out the Car class to see a bad implementation
- Check out the CarSRP and RadioSRP classes to see a better implementation using Single Responsibility Principle
