# SOLID Principles with Examples
Created by: Christopher Arcos ([@ArcosChris](https://github.com/ArcosChris))
<hr/>

This repository was created to simplify the SOLID Principles.
This should not be used as the only source since I am still learning, 
but it could be useful to anyone out there who feels a bit stuck with 
these topics. I am not a teacher or instructor this is just based on 
information I have learned.

In this repository there are different packages in <code>/src/com/solidprinciples</code>
The different packages have information for the different principles in SOLID.

1. **SRP - Single Responsibility Principle**
   - States that a class should only have one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility

   <br/>
   
2. **OCP - Open/Closed Principle**
   - States that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Existing code should not be modified, but it should be possible to add new functionality without changing the existing code
   
    <br/>
    
3. **LSP - LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE**
    - States that object of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without altering
      the correctness of the program.
    
    <br/>
    
4. **ISP - INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE**
    - States that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

    <br/>
   
5. **DIP - DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE**
    - States that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
